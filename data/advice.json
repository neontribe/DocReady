You and your GP need to work together to understand each other. But sometimes, relationships can be difficult for all kinds of reasons.</P>\r\n\r\nIf you aren’t happy with how your first visit went, it’s best to raise this with you GP so they can change things for future visits. You could bring it up the next time you see them, or even send them a letter explaining what didn’t work for you.</P>\r\n\r\n <P>Some reasons people give for feeling unhappy with GP visits include feeling like their GP is not listening to them, feeling that the GP didn’t know enough about mental health, feeling patronised, being dismissed or not being taken seriously, or feeling like the GP didn’t explain things well or used too much confusing language.</P>\r\n\r\n <P>You can always request to see a different GP the next time you make an appointment. You can even ask if anyone working at the practice specialises in mental health. Remember, you can ask to speak to a receptionist at a practice in private if you need to.</P<\r\n\r\n <P>If you wish to make a formal complaint about a GP or another member of staff in a practice, there are steps you can take.</P>\r\n\r\n <P>All GP practices should have a written complaints procedure, which reception staff should give to you if you ask for it. The complaints procedure might also be available on the practice website. You can also ask at reception for a meeting with the Practice Manager or write a letter to the Practice Manager listing the things you’re unhappy about.</P>\r\n\r\n <P>If you don’t feel that your complaint is being dealt with, you could speak to your local Healthwatch or Health board. These local organisations are ‘consumer champions’ for people who use health and social care services. If your GP surgery is in England, you can find your local Healthwatch at <a target='_blank' href='http://www.healthwatch.co.uk/find-local-healthwatch'>Healthwatch.co.uk</a>. Local Healthwatch organisations vary in what level of support and advice they give.</P>\r\n\r\n <P>If your GP surgery is in Scotland, you can register a complaint on mygov.scot. </P>\r\n\r\n <P>If your GP surgery is in Wales, you can register a complaint with Health in Wales.</P>\r\n\r\n <P>If your GP surgery is in Northern Ireland, you can register a complaint with NI direct.</P>\r\n\r\n <P>The body that regulates doctors is the General Medical Council. Here is their guide to what you should expect from a doctor: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/patients.asp'>GMC Guidance</a> </P>\r\n\r\n <P>This is The General Medical Council’s guide to complaining about a doctor: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.gmc-uk.org/concerns/making_a_complaint/a_patients_guide.asp'>GMC-Complaints</a> </P>\r\n\r\n <P>You can change GP practice at any time to another practice that is accepting new patients. </P>",

    "body": "<P> A general practitioner, or GP, is a local doctor who can help with all kinds of health related questions. They’re usually based at health centres in the community called practices. Most practices have more than one doctor. </P> \r\n\r\n  <P> GPs are not usually specialists in specific areas of medicine. Rather, they are available to help you look after your general health and wellbeing. A GP can give you advice, prescribe medicines and treatments and refer you to specialists for more specific care. It’s their job to help you get the care you need to be as healthy as you can be. </P> \r\n\r\n  <P> GPs are here to help you look out for your whole health, both physical and mental health. Feeling sad, confused, angry, anxious or having disruptive thoughts can affect your health just as much as physical injury. </P> \r\n\r\n  <P> When you see a GP, they’ll ask you questions about any health problem that is troubling you. After asking questions, having a discussion with you, and perhaps looking at any physically affected areas, they will then be able to explain what they think might be causing your health problems. They will suggest treatments and a course of action to help you get better. </P> \r\n\r\n  <P> You’ll find that you work best with your GP when you’ve begun to build a relationship together, so they understand you and you feel comfortable talking about your concerns. It’s better to go and see a GP before any problems get more serious. </P>",

You do not have to tell any reception staff why you want a double appointment.<P>\r\n\r\n<P>Right at the start of your appointment try to tell the GP what you want to talk about.  When the GP asks you questions be as honest as you can.  They’ll use what you say to work out what’s wrong or what might help, so it really helps to be open.<P>\r\n\r\n<P>Your appointment should be a two-way conversation.  It’s your appointment and your health so don’t be afraid to ask questions, especially if the doctor says something you don’t understand or which doesn’t sound right to you.<P> \r\n\r\n<P>If you are really worried about the appointment you can take a friend or family member with you.  This might give you more confidence to talk to the doctor.
