You could bring it up the next time you see them, or even send them a letter setting out the bits of the consultation that didn’t work for you.</P>\r\n\r\n<P>If you want to, you can always request to see a different GP the next time you make an appointment, or ask if there is anyone working at the practice who specialises in mental health.

The complaints procedure might also be available on the practice website.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>If you feel that you need to you can ask at reception for a meeting with the Practice Manager.  You can also write a letter to the Practice Manager listing the things you are unhappy about.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>If you don’t feel that your complaint is being dealt with you could speak to your local Healthwatch.  Local Healthwatch organisations have been set up to be ‘consumer champions’ for people who use health and social care services, of which GPs surgeries are one.  You can find your local Healthwatch here: <a target='_blank' href='http://www.healthwatch.co.uk/find-local-healthwatch'>Healthwatch.co.uk</a>.

It’s their job to try to get you the help you need to be as well as you can be. <P>\r\n\r\n<P> GPs help with physical health issues, but also help with mental health issues, too.  You take them the health problem that’s causing you trouble.  They ask you questions about the problem and, if it’s something physical, try to take a look at it or get more information.  They will then explain what they think might be causing the health problem you’re having and suggest treatments or steps you might take to help it to either cure it or make it less of a problem.<P>\r\n\r\n<P>GPs are there to look out for your whole health.  Feeling sad, confused, angry, anxious or having disruptions to your thoughts, and your sleep has an effect on your health that can be just as large as an easier-to-see problem.<P>\r\n\r\n<P>GPs work best when they can get to know you a bit, so it’s often better to go and see a GP before any problems you’re having get more serious.<P>\r\n\r\nGPs don’t just give prescriptions for medicines.
